# Example of Data Models
1. ## Components of Data Model
    1. Data structures
    1. Integrity constraints (完整性约束)
    1. operations

1. ## Types of models
    1. Entity-Relationship Model
    1. Relational Model
    1. Hierarchical Model

1. ## Example of Data Model: Relational Model
    1. Basics
        * Schema: table name, Column name, data type; stable over time
        * State: rows; dynamic ,reflects the state of reality

    1. Constraints (e.g.)
        * email must be unique
        * email not NULL
        * birthdate after 1900-01-01
        * Hometown must be a city in the US
    
    1. Operations
        * insert into [tablename]
        * select [attributes] from [tablename]

    1. Keys and Identifiers
        * keys are uniqueness constraints

    1. Integrity and Consistency
        * Integrity: Does the database reflect reality well?
            * e.g. database without column gender, the name itself might be misleading
        * Consistency: Is the database without internal conflicts?
            * The address and currentCity data conflicts 

    1. Surrogates - Things and Names
        * Name-based Representation: 
            * data item: email, name and Address
            * Use email to identify the user, but it might change
        * Surrogate-based Representaiton
            * Surrogate: system-generated unique, internal identifier
            * Use a system-generated user id as surrogate to represent the users. 
            * Other information may change but the Surrogate doesn't
        
1. ## Architecture
    1. ANSI/SPARC 3-Level DB Architecture: Seperating Concerns
        * Schema: Intension(types)
        * Data: Extension (data)
        1. Model:
        external schema -> conceptual schema -> internal schema -> database
        1. * external schema: use of data
            * conceptual schema: meaning of data
            * internal schema: storage of data
    1. Conceptual Schema
        * Describes all conceptually relevant, general, time-invariant structural aspects of reality
        * Excludes acpects of data representation and physical organization and access
        * e.g. Email, birthdate, hometown...
            ```
            select Email, BirthDate, MaidenName
                from RegularUser
                where Sex='F' and Salary > 70000;
            ```

    1. External Schema
        * Describes parts of the information in the conceptual schema in a form convenient to a particular user group's view
        * Is derived from the conceptual schema
        * e.g. [view]
            ``` 
            create view HighPayFemales as 
                select Email, MaidenName, CurrentCity
                from RegularUser
                where Sex='F' and Salary > 70000
                order by MaidenName;
            ```
    1. Internal Schema
        * Describes how the information described in the conceptual schema is physically represented to provide the overall best **performance**
        * if the salary is frequently visited, it might be good to define salary as index(?
        * if currentCity is frequently required, a new internal table might need for a more convenient access for CurrentCity
    
    1. Physical Data Independence
        * is the measure of how much the internal schema can change without affecting the application programs
