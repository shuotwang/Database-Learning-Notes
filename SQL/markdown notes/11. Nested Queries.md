# Nested Queries

## Keyword: IN
first execute the inner, then go to the outer

1. Find the names of all employees who have dsold over 30000 to a single client

        SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
        FROM employee
        WHERE employee.emp_id IN(
            SELECT works_with.emp_id
            FROM works_with
            WHERE works_with.total_sales > 30000
        );

1. find all clients who are handled by the branch that Michael Scott manages, assume you know Michael's ID

        SELECT client.client_name 
        FROM client
        WHERE client.branch_id = (
            SELECT branch.branch_id
            FROM branch
            WHERE branch.mgr_id = 102
            LIMIT 1
        );
    * if use **=** sign, then the nested part must return only one piece of information, so better add **LIMIT 1**
