# Triggers

1. Before I insert any information into the employee table, for each new item that gets inserted, the value (add new employee) will be inserted into trigger_test table. 

        DELIMITER $$
        CREATE
            TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
            ON employee
            FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
                INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('add new employee');
            END $$
        DELIMITER ;

1. Delimiter: 定界符
    
    * By default the delimiter is a semi-colon
    * But in the above example, the ';' is used inside the CREATE block
    * So change the delimiter to double dollar sign
    * In PopSQL app, the delimiter does not work -> use trigger in Terminal


1. More examples

    1. NEW.attribute: 
        
            DELIMITER $$
            CREATE
                TRIGGER my_trigger1 BEFORE INSERT
                ON employee
                FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
                    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES(NEW.first_name);
                END $$
            DELIMITER ;
    

    2. IF statements

            CREATE
            TRIGGER my_trigger2 BEFORE INSERT
            ON employee
            FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
                IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN
                    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('Added male employee);
                ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
                    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('Added female employee);
                ELSE
                    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('Added other employee);
                END IF;
            END $$
    
    1. Also can use trigger before UPDATE or DELETE
    1. Drop a trigger
